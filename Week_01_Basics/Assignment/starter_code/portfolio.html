My expertise is working collabortively with Editors, Illustrators, and Project Managers to ensure a smoothly run project. I am currently taking a front end web development course from <a class="heads" href="https://generalassemb.ly/">General Assembly</a> to enhance my skills and bring the same creativity to interactive media pieces.
